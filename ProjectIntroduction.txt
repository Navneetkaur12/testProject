In today's advanced world of technology, information is the supreme power for the investigators to solve diverse kind of crime cases such as kidnapping , theft, assault and so on efficiently and quickly. therefore, several applications are developed for the police department to solve the criminal cases . One of it is  Crime scene tracker which helps the law enforcement agencies to create  electronic records for the evidences collected at the crime scene , people involved and the summary of the case which in turn help them to keep a track of the multiple cases at a time . In addition to that, it helps to manage team workflow . For instance ,if a group of officers involved in the same case investigation and one of them is not able to continue the investigation from the same place then he can track the status of the case through this application and keeps themselves up to date regarding the case information . Furthermore , admin can update the status of the case by upload the photos related to the crime scene and the items found on scene . Activities that are stored in the database related to the crime cannot be shared with everyone not even to that person who register for the complaint . Through this application police department can easily manage investigation , crime and case details.
In this existing application , there is no database on criminals that contain the details about the criminal past misdeeds and in how many terrorist activities they are included . if this information will included in the offense investigation application it will definitely help the officers to solve the case in less interval of time.          

This is another line.
